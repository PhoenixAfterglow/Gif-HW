# GifTastic Assignment
by Johnny Maravelis


### Overview


This homework felt a bit easier compared to the last few assignments, probably because building game logic is more complex.  I feel comfortable using APIs and looking up their documentation.  The hardest part of the assignment was figuring out how to make the buttons react the way you want, but thankfully the class work already had working examples so I worked off of that.


### How to Use

Simply click on the pre-built buttons to reveal the Star Trek: The Next Generation character(s) or type a character's name and hit submit in order to create your own button.  Once a button is clicked, 10 gifs will be generated below.  The gifs are paused at default, but when clicked, they begin to play, and clicked again pauses / restarts the gif.

### Future Improvements

Was working on the "Bonus" features to add.  I ran out of time to add more meta data, such as the Title of the gif, integrate another API, and create a "Favorites" section.  Again, these were bonus items but it would be good to figure out how to do this and add these features to improve this experience.  Lastly, more from a GUI / UI / UX perspective if I had more time I also wanted to have the gif react kind of like how they do in Netflix when you select / hover over the target item, essentially, making the gif image increase in size and play as you hover, then "shrink" back down and paused when not hovering over.
